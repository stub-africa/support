With stub you can create, send and track payments of invoices. 

When you use stub to do your invoicing, stub learns about about your business. Over time we'll show insights about what types of invoices get paid the fastest, which of them are more profitable, and much more.

## Creating an invoice

You can create as many invoices as you like from the invoices page. 

## Sending an invoice

Invoices are sent as emails to your clients. Open an invoice and choose "send".

Why email? 

- Email is a widely adopted and very portable technology. Your customers don't need to download any software to view their invoice — it just works — no matter what device or platform they're on.
- Occasionally we make a mistake on an invoice. When that happens, you can just update the invoice and send it again. Your client gets the new invoice and you're good to go. You can even include a note explaning the change on the invoice. 

## Adding payments

When a customer pays you, open up the invoice and choose "add payment". You can add as many payments as you need for the invoice. 

Each payment that gets made will be added to the invoice so you can keep track of the outstanding balance. If you want to, you can send an updated invoice to your client showing the payments and the outstanding balance.

## Invoice content

You can customise pretty much everything on the invoice. Just click on any content on the invoice to edit it. 

### Logo

Upload your company logo and it will show up on your invoices. 

### Invoice number

Every invoice gets a unique invoice number.

You can override the invoice number if you like, but stub will automatically generate a unique invocie number when you first create an invoice.

### Description

This content shows near the top of the invoice. Use it to include a brief description of what the invoice is for, or include a personal note for your client.

### Invoice Date

This is the date when the invoice is issued — note that this is not the same as the due date of the invoice below. 

### From

This is your company information. It automatically shows on any invoice that you create. 

<p class="callout">Note that for your invoice to be legally binding it must include your business name and address.</p>
